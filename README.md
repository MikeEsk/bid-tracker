# Construction Bid Tracker

o	Full stack web application for Construction companies to track subcontractor bids during the contract pursuit process.  Dynamic web interface for customizing subcontractor trades involved in the project, entering and editing construction bids, bid leveling (adding additional items to bids to ensure proposals are equivalent in scope), and tabulated bid summaries for analyzing data and awarding subcontracts.

o	The web application uses React.js for client side rendering and requests from the backend.  Uses a functional component structure with the Context API for state management, coupled with a Reducer for updating state.  The backend RESTful API uses Express.js with the Node.js runtime to receive and process asynchronous fetch calls from the client side.  The server uses a PostgreSQL database for persistent data management of the users, companies, subcontractors, trades, and bids with a multi-table schema.
